# realdispomailgen
Generates disposable emails with realistic names instead of a randomly generated string.

# How it works:
A long list of random names(primarily american and scandinavian) and a randomly generated string of numbers with a varying length.
Instead of a disposable mail looking like this: oJ2pd9mD@disposeamail.com.
It looks like this: JohnDoe1993@disposeamail.com.
It can create thousands of emails every second.

# List of names:
'names.txt' is a list full of names, but formatted in the exact way, which the programs needs the names to be like. You can create your own list with the same formatting.
**Formatting:** John Doe --> JohnDoe         (just remove all spaces between the first- and last name.
